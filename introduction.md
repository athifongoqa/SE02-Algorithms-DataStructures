# Introduction

Data structures and Algorithms deals with how the different elements computer programs of can best be represented and processed to achieve specific goals and their respective efficiencies, and that is what SE02 - Data Structures and Algorithms aims at teaching us.&#x20;

Efficiency is the main concern of this module and topic in general, in terms of space and time complexity. In this portfolio I will mainly deal with the latter of the two. The main question which should be considered when discussing time complexity is: "How does the runtime of this function grow as the input grows?". Meaning that time complexity gives us a rough idea of how functions in programs scale as their respective inputs gets larger and larger.&#x20;

And with this in mind, let us now consider the different time complexities we will run into later, represented as growth rates.&#x20;
