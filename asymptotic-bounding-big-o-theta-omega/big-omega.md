# Big-Omega

The notation $$Ω(n)$$ is the formal way of expressing an algorithm runtime's lower bound. It is used to measure the best case time complexity or the least amount of operations an algorithm can possibly perform to complete.

**Formally:**

"$$T(n)$$ is $$Ω(f(n))$$", if for some constants $$k$$ and $$n_0$$, $$T(n) >= k ⋅ f(n)$$ for all $$n >= n_0$$&#x20;

**Informally**:

"$$T(n)$$ is $$Ω(f(n))$$" $$f(n)$$ describes the lower bound for $$T(n)$$ where $$n >= n_0$$.

**Put simply:**

"$$T(n)$$ is $$Ω(f(n))$$", growth rate of $$T(n) >=$$ growth rate of $$f(n)$$where $$n >= n_0$$.
