# Benefits

**Benefits of Asymptotic Notation:**

* A great way of thinking about Asymptotic Notation is like making a ranking system for the runtime of different algorithms as its input grows.&#x20;
* It is great and important because it gives programmers (and mathematicians) a vocabulary to discuss their code and the trade offs between different potential approaches.&#x20;
* It is also useful because when your program slows down or crashes, you can identify the inefficiencies in your code a lot quicker.&#x20;
  * Just trying to manually track performance is inefficient because times will inevitably differ based on different external factors. Rather than counting seconds taken, which are so variable, we count the number of simple operations the computer must perform to complete a task.
