# Big-O

The notation $$O(n)$$ is a formal way to expressing an algorithm runtime's upper bound. It is used to measure the worst case time complexity or the most number of operations an algorithm can possibly perform, in the worst case scenario.

**Formally:**

"$$T(n)$$ is$$O(f(n))$$", if for some constants $$k$$ and $$n_0$$, $$T(n) <= k â‹… f(n)$$ for all$$n >= n_0$$&#x20;

**Informally:**

"$$T(n)$$ is $$O(f(n))$$", $$f(n)$$ describes the upper bound for $$T(n)$$ where $$n >= n_0$$.



**Put simply:**

"$$T(n)$$ is $$O(f(n))$$", growth rate of  $$T(n) <=$$ growth rate of $$f(n)$$ where $$n >= n_0$$.
