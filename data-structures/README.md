# Data Structures - Basic

Data Structures are a specialized means of organizing and storing data in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the stored data more efficiently. Data structures have a wide and diverse scope of usage across the fields of Computer Science and Software Engineering.

For the simplicity of following each topic in this section, the items below will act as a general skeleton for how we will be performing an analysis on each of the data structures still to come:

* How the data structure organizes and manipulates data
* What operations can be done on it and what their time complexities are
* And/or caveats of the data structure&#x20;
* And/or its applications
