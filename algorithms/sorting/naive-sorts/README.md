# Naïve Sorts

Naïve Sorts are not as efficient as the upcoming Optimal Sorts. They all have a time complexity of $$O(n^2)$$. The reason for this is that for every item in the input, we may have to consider all the other items alongside it to make sure it is in the right position. They are intuitive sorts and this is why they are considered Naïve, and as opposed to Optimal Sorts, they are extremely inefficient.&#x20;
