# Absolutely Useless

So far, we have been dealing with efficiencies of different algorithms and discriminating them based on how well they perform but I wanted to look into some inefficient algorithms in the hopes of analyzing the higher order growth rates too. I plan to still grow this list with more sorting and searching algorithms because I find some approaches comical and I'd also like to have a frame of reference as to how bad things can really get if solutions are ill-considered.&#x20;
