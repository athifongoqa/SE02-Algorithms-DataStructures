# Sorting

Sorting is a task that can be a deciding factor in the overall performance of the system. In this section, we will consider six different algorithms that can sort given input by changing the order of said elements in an array. The performance of these algorithms can vary widely. Some algorithms are complex but are extremely efficient, some are slow but easy to write.&#x20;
