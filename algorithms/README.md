# Algorithms - Basic

It is easy to listen to public discourse about Algorithms and think they are extremely complicated processes performed by computers but in reality, we encounter Algorithms on a daily basis. Essentially, an Algorithm is a set of steps leading to a desired end result. When you bake a cake, the steps in the recipe act as the Algorithm to achieve the end result of the finished cake. The same applies to Algorithms in the domain of Computer Science and Software Engineering. In this section we will deal with Algorithms which help us search, sort and traverse elements in different data structures to achieve specific goals based on specific criteria respectively.

Although each Algorithm works differently, the following will act as a general means of analyzing them:

* A detailed description of the algorithm
* Goal of the algorithm
* Termination condition
* Explanation of the steps of the algorithm
* A specific example illustrating how the algorithm works
* Best, Average and Worst cases
* Implementation
