# Constant Growth Rate - f(1)

A constant resource need is one where the resource need does not grow. That is processing 1 piece of data takes the same amount of resource as processing 1 million pieces of data. No matter what the input value is, and/or how many inputs or elements are dealt with, the algorithm will always take the same amount of time to execute. The graph of such a growth rate looks like a horizontal line parallel to the x-axis.&#x20;
