# Logarithmic Growth Rate â€“ f(logn)

A logarithmic growth rate is a growth rate where the resource needs grow by one unit each time the data is doubled. This effectively means that as the amount of data gets bigger, the curve describing the growth rate gets flatter (closer to horizontal but never reaching it). The following graph shows what a curve of this nature would look like.
