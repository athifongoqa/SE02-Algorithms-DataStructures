# Order of Dominance in the Asymptotic Limit

To further visualize the difference between some of the most common time complexities, look at this graph below (where you can now see the different functions in relation to one another), where the x-axis represents the size of the input (Elements) of the functions and the y-axis represents the number of operations needed to execute the program or function.

&#x20;

We can see that the dominance order of these functions is:&#x20;&#x20;

$$n!$$$$>$$ $$2^n$$$$>$$$$n^2$$$$>$$$$nlogn$$$$>$$$$n$$$$>$$$$logn$$$$>$$$$1$$



As you can see from the graph, understanding how to analyze your algorithms can save you a great deal of time and resources in the end.
