# Preface

The problem I found whilst trying to gather resources to learn from and use to structure my portfolio, a lot of the resources only explain a certain aspect or part of a topic and not in as much detail and clarity as I might've liked, or even worse, every explanation is so convoluted that it actually becomes hard to follow one topic in one sitting.&#x20;

It made it such that I would have to consult different resources to explain a concept that only needed about one page or less of explanation. So with that, I tried my best to structure this portfolio so that it could not only act as a future resource for me, but possibly a starting point for someone starting the module. I tried my best to plug some of the holes I encountered whilst wandering from tutorial to tutorial. I intend to still add onto this in future for when I re-assess for a higher level.&#x20;
